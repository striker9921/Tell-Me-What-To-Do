# Tell-Me-What-To-Do
This is a TODO list project that will be written in Python3, potentially developed into a web application with django. The goal of this project is to create a task list program that organizes things that need to be done by importance, deadline, and other metrics, and when prompted, the program should return the most important thing to do at the moment.
